1) Add javascript to check when window reaches a certain minimum size and then force an x scroll bar (should help with mobile compatability etc).
2) Replace background image with a higher quality image including grass, ow! disc and a pair of cleats.
3) Replace Shoddy table title bar with nicely drawn buttons. Could be acheived with HTML5 canvas tags + javascript.
4) link the twitter/facebook feed into the main page.
5) add image rotation in image box.


?) add form to allow players to create own player profile (is this something that can be abused easily?)
