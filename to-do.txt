1) Provide a more effecient JS function to draw DEM rounded rectangles. (check if it works now)
2) Get this layout to be checked with JD, Harry, etc.
3) Send out an email to the mail-list asking where all the pictures are at... (maybe best to ask Hazard)
4) link the twitter/facebook feed into the main page. (CHECK FB/TWITTER API?!?!?!)



?) add form to allow players to create own player profile (is this something that can be abused easily?)
            |   what if the form emailed it to oxforduniultimate email or otherwise?
